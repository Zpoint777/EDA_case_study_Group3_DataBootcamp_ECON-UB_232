This is the readme of the work.  
If you change something or want to explain your work.  
Write it here.    
  
Zien: question, does anyone know where we should submit the work?  
Btw, currently I am going to work on the variables related with "days" in it, generally the variables focusing on the last loan's situation. Or say "credit and history"
  
I think maybe you two can divide and do the 'Demographics' variables and 'Income & Financial' area? Are you guys ok with that? Or if you have a good idea on what to work on, please write it here.  
 
Feel free to update your work, question, response or suggestions here
